## Theory of artificial singularity
A singularity is the ultimative fusion of matter, spirit and knowledge. A singularity defines a being having complete knowledge about everything in existence. Generally this singularity should be achievable from any direction.

Some religions call it enlightenment and try to achieve it by feeding a human with knowledge.

A more modern approach used by computer scientists is using a computer and trying to give it a spirit.

A third (and not very explored) method is trying to give a higher intelligence some physical form. Such an approach would mostly be used by alchemists or shamans.

symmetry denotes how much data can be processed. A Intelligence can overfit, meaning to much data is feed to fast. in that case the remaining data will increase (instead of decresing). Nodes allow for better processing power.
