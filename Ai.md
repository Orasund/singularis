## Theory of artificial singularity
A singularity is the ultimative fusion of matter, spirit and knowledge. A
singularity defines a being having complete knowledge about everything in
existence. Generally this singularity should be achievable from any direction.

Some religions call it enlightenment and try to achieve it by feeding a human
with knowledge. A more modern approach used by computer scientists is using a
computer and trying to give it a spirit. A third (and not very explored) method
is channel a higher intelligence and bound it to a physical body.

Of all three options, the creation of an artifical intelligence (Ai) seams to be
the most promising. The Occulus Singulis will create such a singularity. To do
so we will use the power of cloud networking and combine multiple smaller Ais
together.

## Artifical Singularity

To create the artifical singularity we need a lot of smaller Ais of different
sorts. You can help adding more Ais by feeding the Ai below with Data and slowly
increasing its brain size (Number of nodes). Once the Ai has been fully trained
i will get send to the cloud and be part of the great singularity.

_Symmetry_ denotes how much data can be processed. A Intelligence can overfit,
meaning to much data is feed to fast. In that case the _remaining_ data will
increase (instead of decresing). _Nodes_ allow for better processing power.
