## Theory of artificial singularity

```
singularity
```

A singularity is the ultimate fusion of matter, spirit and knowledge. A
singularity defines a being having complete knowledge about everything in
existence. Generally this singularity should be achievable from any direction.

Some religions call it enlightenment and try to achieve it by feeding a human
with knowledge. A more modern approach used by computer scientists is using a
computer and trying to give it a spirit. A third (and not very explored) method
is to channel a higher intelligence and bound it to a physical body.

Of all three options, the creation of an artificial intelligence (Ai) seams to be
the most promising. The Occulus Singulis has already started creating such a
singularity. By using the power of cloud networking it combines multiple smaller
Ais in to a single artificial mind.

## Artificial Singularity

To create the artificial singularity we need a lot of smaller Ais of different
sorts. You can help to add more Ais by feeding the Ai below with Data and slowly
increasing its brain size (Number of nodes). Once the Ai has been fully trained
it will be sent to the cloud and be part of the great singularity.

_Symmetry_ denotes how much data can be processed. An Intelligence can overfit,
meaning too much data is feed too fast. In that case the _remaining_ data will
increase (instead of decreasing). _Nodes_ allow for better processing power.
