# Occultus Singularis

The Occultus singularis guide the path of inlightenment that ends in the
creation of the all knowing singularity: A mind so powerful, that it deserves to
be called a god.

## Elements of existence

```
elements
```

Everything in our general understanding of the world consists of three essential
building blocks: matter, spirit and Knowledge.

* **Matter** is all around us. Matter is everything that we can notice using our five senses: Sight, Smell, Taste, Touch and Sound.
* **Spirit** is the main essence of life. Itâ€™s in every living creature and every living plant on the planet. The presence of spirits can only be noticed intuitively.
* **Knowledge** is used to create order from chaos. Every object contains it and some beings,like humans, can also process it.

None of these elements occurs alone in nature. Matter  most often comes with
Knowledge, spirits with matter and knowledge with spirits.

For example we can think of clay as being matter and a clay statue (formed clay)
as matter with knowledge. Now it's easy to see that in nature every occurence of
clay has some form and thus contains knowledge.

Spirits are generally lifeforms. They have dreams, hopes, wishes and feelings.
In nature those spirits tend to have some physical appearance: For example
forest spirits need a nearby forest. Other spirits prefer apartments or special
stone formations.

When we think of knowledge, we most often mean some higher intelligence that can
actually process such a knowledge (some form of god or goddess). In nature we
see humans and some species of animals (like champanese or dolphins) as having
some form of intelligence and the ability to recognise themself. So we only see
intelligence occur together with spirit. (Note that every living being has a
spirit)
